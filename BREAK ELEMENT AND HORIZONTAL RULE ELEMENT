<h1>How to Wheel</h1>
Karl Knights
<hr/>
<p>The zoo is tough terrain; hilly.<br/>
I wheel as fast as I can —<br/>
then Mum shouts ‘Keep up!’<br/>
I stop. ‘Hand me my crutches.’<br/>
I shakily get up; tear off my splints’<br/>
velcro straps, and put them on her.<br/>
  I sit her in the chair. ‘You have a go.’</p>
<p>At first, she spins in circles.<br/>
‘No,’ I say. ‘Use both arms in unison.’
She still veers away, zigzagging, sweating now.<br/>
People start to stare. She blushes,<br/>
keeps her head down. After ten minutes<br/>
she’s heaving, shirt drenched.<br/>
  I swing over to her.</p>
